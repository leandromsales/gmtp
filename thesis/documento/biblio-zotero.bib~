	abstract = {Recently, video streaming services using {P2P(Peer-to-Peer)} have attracted attention to solve the problem of load concentration on servers and reduce a lot of latency. Many {P2P} streaming systems, like Coolstreaming, however, have a complicated approach to control playback timings severely. And this leads to less churn resiliency and less adaptability to fluctuation of network traffic. Therefore, we focus on a simple and robust approach to realize “pseudo” streaming with high quality, which is based on {BitTorrent.} In the existing methods with the simple approach, peers download pieces just closer to playback timings to decrease the playback discontinuity. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a new {P2P} video streaming system considering the cooperation of three metrics; video structure, playback timings, and pieces dispersion on network. In this system, users vary three piece selections to suit the delivery status. Specifically, users preferentially download pieces which affect the 
video quality, are closer to playback timings, and improve the delivery efficiency. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by computer simulation.},

	abstract = {{BitTorrent} has been a very successful peer-to-peer {(P2P)} file-sharing application, and several {BitTorrent-based} {P2P} video streaming systems have been proposed in the literature. Nowadays, network address translation {(NAT)} has been widely used since it reduces the usage of {IP} addresses, but it is also considered as a factor that degrades the performance of {P2P} systems because {NAT} limits the direction of connectivity. In order to understand what impact {NAT} has on the performance of {BitTorrent-based} {P2P} video streaming systems, we build an analytical model which can be used to predict the average continuity index, a video streaming performance metric, when a fraction of the participating peers are behind {NAT} devices. A software simulator is written to validate our analytical model, and the simulation results also give some insights on the fairness issue of {P2P} video streaming systems in the presence of {NAT} devices. In this paper, both our analytical model and simulation 
results are presented and verified.},

	abstract = {{BitTorrent} is the most successful open Internet application for content distribution. Despite its importance, both in terms of its footprint in the Internet and the influence it has on emerging {P2P} applications, the {BitTorrent} Ecosystem is only partially understood. We seek to provide a nearly complete picture of the entire public {BitTorrent} Ecosystem. To this end, we crawl five of the most popular torrent-discovery sites over a ine-month period, identifying all of 4.6 million and 38,996 trackers that the sites reference. We also develop a high-performance tracker crawler, and over a narrow window of 12 hours, crawl essentially all of the public Ecosystem's trackers, obtaining peer lists for all referenced torrents. Complementing the torrent-discovery site and tracker crawling, we further crawl Azureus and Mainline {DHTs} for a random sample of torrents. Our resulting measurement data are more than an order of magnitude larger (in terms of number of torrents, trackers, or peers) than any 
earlier study. Using this extensive data set, we study in-depth the Ecosystem's torrent-discovery, tracker, peer, user behavior, and content landscapes. For peer statistics, the analysis is based on one typical snapshot obtained over 12 hours. We further analyze the fragility of the Ecosystem upon the removal of its most important tracker service.},

	abstract = {In tree-based multicast systems, a relatively small number of interior nodes carry the load of forwarding multicast messages. This works well when the interior nodes are highly-available, dedicated infrastructure routers but it poses a problem for application-level multicast in peer-to-peer systems. {SplitStream} addresses this problem by striping the content across a forest of interior-node-disjoint multicast trees that distributes the forwarding load among all participating peers. For example, it is possible to construct efficient {SplitStream} forests in which each peer contributes only as much forwarding bandwidth as it receives. Furthermore, with appropriate content encodings, {SplitStream} is highly robust to failures because a node failure causes the loss of a single stripe on average. We present the design and implementation of {SplitStream} and show experimental results obtained on an Internet testbed and via large-scale network simulation. The results show that {SplitStream} 
distributes the forwarding load among all peers and can accommodate peers with different bandwidth capacities while imposing low overhead for forest construction and maintenance.},

In order to gain insights into mesh-pull {P2P} {IPTV} systems and the traffic loads they place on {ISPs}, we have undertaken an in-depth measurement study of one of the most popular {IPTV} systems, namely, {PPLive.} We have developed a dedicated {PPLive} crawler, which enables us to study the global characteristics of the mesh-pull {PPLive} system. We have also collected extensive packet traces for various different measurement scenarios, including both campus access networks and residential access networks. The measurement results obtained through these platforms bring important insights into {P2P} {IPTV} systems. Specifically, our results show the following. 1) {P2P} {IPTV} users have the similar 
viewing behaviors as regular {TV} users. 2) During its session, a peer exchanges video data dynamically with a large number of peers. 3) A small set of super peers act as video proxy and contribute significantly to video data uploading. 4) Users in the measured {P2P} {IPTV} system still suffer from long start-up delays and playback lags, ranging from several seconds to a couple of minutes. Insights obtained in this study will be valuable for the development and deployment of future {P2P} {IPTV} systems.},

We first describe the construction of the test-bed based upon Internet measurements between geographically distributed hosts. Then, we present a methodology for evaluating these {P2P} video streaming systems by performing video quality and network usage analysis from the log information obtained via running these systems on the test-bed. Our methodology to assess {P2P} live video streaming systems comprises analyzing the objective quality of the received video, waiting time to receive the first data byte, and several network usage measures such as {P2P} protocol overhead, load on the server due to the inefficiencies of the {P2P} overlay, and measurements of the number of bytes exchanged between the peers. It is essential that every peer buffers packets for some time before playing out the 
video in order to ensure good quality. We report the time that the user has to wait before he can see the video playing. These measurements not only gauge the performance of currently available {P2P} streaming systems but also highlight desired improvements in current {P2P} video streaming systems.},

While recent measurement studies have shown the effectiveness of {P2P} network in media streaming, there have been questions raised about the Quality of Service {(QoS)}, reliability of streaming services and sub optimal uplink utilization in particular. We present a new model for {P2P} media streaming where nodes cluster into groups, called alliances, for a symbiotic association in order to share the media content. We show that alliance formation is an effective way to organize the peers in loosely coupled groups. The node topology formed using alliances generates a Small World Network, which exhibit efficient overlay structures in terms of path lengths between the nodes and robustness to network perturbations like churn. We present a comparative performance evaluation of our model with {CoolStreaming/DONet} on {QoS} metrics.},

Thus the key to realizing {P2P's} potential in applications other than casual file sharing is {robustness.P2P} search methods are first couched within an overall {P2P} taxonomy. {P2P} indexes for simple key lookup are assessed, including those based on Plaxton trees, rings, tori, butterflies, de Bruijn graphs and skip graphs. Similarly, {P2P} indexes for keyword lookup, information retrieval and data management are explored. Finally, early efforts to optimize range, multiattribute, join and aggregation queries over {P2P} indexes are reviewed. Insofar as they are available in the primary 
literature, robustness mechanisms and metrics are highlighted throughout. However, the low-level mechanisms that most affect robustness are not well isolated in the literature. Furthermore, there has been little consensus on robustness metrics. Recommendations are given for future research.},

Although the scalability of these protocols has been evaluated mostly for sequential user accesses, a high degree of interactivity has been observed in the accesses to several real media servers. Moreover, some studies have indicated that user interactivity can severely penalize the scalability of stream sharing {protocols.This} paper investigates alternative mechanisms for scalable streaming to interactive users. We first identify a set of workload aspects that are determinant to the scalability of classes of streaming protocols. Using real workloads and a new interactive media workload generator, we build a rich set of realistic synthetic workloads. We evaluate Bandwidth Skimming and Patching, two state-of-the-art streaming protocols, covering, with our workloads, a larger region of the design space 
than previous work. Finally, we propose and evaluate five optimizations to Bandwidth Skimming, the most scalable of the two protocols. Our best optimization reduces the average server bandwidth required for interactive workloads in up to 54\%, for unlimited client buffers, and 29\%, if buffers are constrained to 25\% of media size.},

	abstract = {This article presents results from our measurement and modeling efforts on the large-scale peer-to-peer (p2p) overlay graphs spanned by the {PPLive} system, the most popular and largest p2p {IPTV} {(Internet} Protocol Television) system today. Unlike other previous studies on {PPLive}, which focused on either network-centric or user-centric measurements of the system, our study is unique in (a) focusing on {PPLive} overlay-specific characteristics, and (b) being the first to derive mathematical models for its distributions of node degree, session length, and peer participation in simultaneous overlays. Our studies reveal characteristics of multimedia streaming p2p overlays that are markedly different from existing file-sharing p2p overlays. Specifically, we find that: (1) {PPLive} overlays are similar to random graphs in structure and thus more robust and resilient to the massive failure of nodes, (2) Average degree of a peer in the overlay is independent of the channel population size and the 
node degree distribution can be fitted by a piecewise function, (3) The availability correlation between {PPLive} peer pairs is bimodal, that is, some pairs have highly correlated availability, while others have no correlation, (4) Unlike p2p file-sharing peers, {PPLive} peers are impatient and session lengths (discretized, per channel) are typically geometrically distributed, (5) Channel population size is time-sensitive, self-repeated, event-dependent, and varies more than in p2p file-sharing networks, (6) Peering relationships are slightly locality-aware, and (7) Peer participation in simultaneous overlays follows a Zipf distribution. We believe that our findings can be used to understand current large-scale p2p streaming systems for future planning of resource usage, and to provide useful and practical hints for future design of large-scale p2p streaming systems.},

With relative simplicity in design with respect to peer selection and topology construction protocols and without much algorithmic sophistication, current-generation live {P2P} streaming applications are able to provide users with adequately satisfying viewing experiences. That said, little existing research has provided sufficient insights on the time-varying internal characteristics of peer-to-peer topologies in live streaming. This article presents Magellan, our collaborative work with {UUSee} Inc., Beijing, China, for exploring and charting graph theoretical properties of practical {P2P} streaming topologies, gaining important insights in their topological dynamics over a long period of time. With more than 120 {GB} worth of traces starting September 2006 from a commercially deployed {P2P} live streaming system 
that represents {UUSee's} core product, we have completed a thorough and in-depth investigation of the topological properties in large-scale live {P2P} streaming, as well as their evolutionary behavior over time, for example, at different times of the day and in flash crowd scenarios. We seek to explore real-world {P2P} streaming topologies with respect to their graph theoretical metrics, such as the degree, clustering coefficient, and reciprocity. In addition, we compare our findings with results from existing studies on topological properties of {P2P} file sharing applications, and present new and unique observations specific to streaming. We have observed that live {P2P} streaming sessions demonstrate excellent scalability, a high level of reciprocity, a clustering phenomenon in each {ISP}, and a degree distribution that does not follow the power-law distribution.},

For edge-capacitated networks, we show optimality of the so-called ''random-useful'' packet forwarding algorithm. As a byproduct, we obtain a novel proof of a famous theorem of Edmonds, characterising the broadcast capacity of a capacitated graph. For node-capacitated networks, assuming a complete communication graph, we show optimality of the so-called ''most-deprived'' neighbour selection scheme combined with random useful packet selection. We then show that optimality is preserved when each peer can exchange data with a limited number of neighbours, when neighbourhoods are dynamically adapted according to a particular scheme. Finally, we consider the case of multiple information sources, each creating distinct 
information to be disseminated to a specific set of receivers. In this context, we prove optimality of the so-called ''bundled most-deprived neighbour random useful packet'' selection.},

Statistical signatures are derived by the means of a {Chi-Square} (χ2)-like test, which extracts the protocol "format," but ignores the protocol "semantic" and "synchronization" rules. The signatures feed a decision process based either on the geometric distance among samples, or on Support Vector Machines. {KISS} is very accurate, and its signatures are intrinsically robust to packet sampling, reordering, and flow asymmetry, so that it can be used on almost any network. {KISS} is tested in different scenarios, considering traditional client-server protocols, {VoIP}, and both traditional and new {P2P} Internet applications. Results are astonishing. The average True Positive percentage is 99.6\%,

	abstract = {In peer-to-peer {(P2P)} mesh-based streaming systems, each video sequence is typically divided into segments, which are then streamed from multiple senders to a receiver. The receiver needs to coordinate the senders by specifying a transmission schedule for each of them. We consider the scheduling problem in both live and on-demand {P2P} streaming systems. We formulate the problem of scheduling segment transmission in order to maximize the perceived video quality of the receiver. We prove that this problem is {NP-Complete.} We present an integer linear programming {(ILP)} formulation for this problem, and we optimally solve it using an {ILP} solver. This optimal solution, however, is computationally expensive and is not suitable for real-time streaming systems. Thus, we propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, which yields transmission schedules with analytical guarantees on the worst-case performance. More precisely, we show that the approximation factor is at most 3, compared to the 
absolutely optimal solution as a benchmark. We implement the proposed approximation and optimal algorithms in a packet-level simulator for {P2P} streaming systems. We also implement two other scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature and used in popular {P2P} streaming systems. By simulating large {P2P} systems and streaming nine real video sequences with diverse visual and motion characteristics, we demonstrate that our proposed approximation algorithm: (i) produces near-optimal perceived video quality, (ii) can run in real time, and (iii) outperforms other algorithms in terms of perceived video quality, smoothness of the rendered videos, and balancing the load across sending peers. For example, our simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms heuristic algorithms used in current systems by up to 8 {dB} in perceived video quality and up to 20\% in continuity index.},

	abstract = {A number of commercial peer-to-peer {(P2P)} systems for live streaming have been introduced in recent years. The behavior of these popular systems has been extensively studied in several measurement papers. Due to the proprietary nature of these commercial systems, however, these studies have to rely on a "black-box" approach, where packet traces are collected from a single or a limited number of measurement points, to infer various properties of traffic on the control and data planes. Although such studies are useful to compare different systems from the end-user's perspective, it is difficult to intuitively understand the observed properties without fully reverse-engineering the underlying systems. In this paper, we describe the network architecture of Zattoo, one of the largest production live streaming providers in Europe at the time of writing, and present a large-scale measurement study of Zattoo using data collected by the provider. To highlight, we found that even when the Zattoo system 
was heavily loaded with as high as 20 000 concurrent users on a single overlay, the median channel join delay remained less than 2-5 s, and that, for a majority of users, the streamed signal lags over-the-air broadcast signal by no more than 3 s.},

We address several key challenges in the system design and implementation including (a) dynamic resource scaling while guaranteeing stream quality, (b) providing low startup latency, (c) ease of integration with existing {CDN} infrastructure, and (d) ensuring network-friendliness and upload fairness in the {P2P} operation. {LiveSky} has been commercially deployed and used for several large-scale live streaming events serving more than ten million users in China. We evaluate the performance of {LiveSky} using data from these real-world deployments. Our results indicate that such a hybrid {CDN-P2P} 
system provides quality and user performance comparable to a {CDN} and effectively scales the system capacity when the user volume exceeds the {CDN} capacity.},

	abstract = {Several peer-to-peer systems for live streaming have been recently deployed (e.g. {CoolStreaming}, {PPLive}, {SopCast).} These all rely on distributed, epidemic-style dissemination mechanisms. Despite their popularity, the fundamental performance trade-offs of such mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this paper we propose several results that contribute to the understanding of such trade-offs. Specifically, we prove that the so-called random peer, latest useful chunk mechanism can achieve dissemination at an optimal rate and within an optimal delay, up to an additive constant term. This qualitative result suggests that epidemic live streaming algorithms can achieve near-unbeatable rates and delays. Using mean-field approximations, we also derive recursive formulas for the diffusion function of two schemes referred to as latest blind chunk, random peer and latest blind chunk, random useful peer. Finally, we provide simulation results that validate the above theoretical results and allow us 
to compare the performance of various practically interesting diffusion schemes terms of delay, rate, and control overhead. In particular, we identify several peer/chunk selection algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance trade-offs. Moreover, we show that the control overhead needed to implement these algorithms may be reduced by restricting the neighborhood of each peer without substantial performance degradation.},

However, peers, representing rational end users, tend to be non-cooperative when it comes to the duty rather than the self-interests, running counter to the fundamental design philosophy of {P2P} concept. The objective of this paper is to investigate the problem of encouraging users to balance what they take from the system with what they contribute. We first make a statistical analysis to the service logs of a practical {P2P} live video streaming system and reveal intrinsic characteristic of users' online duration. Second, we thus propose a novel incentive mechanism based on the composite contributions which consist of two objective metrics, i.e. the on-line duration and effective upstream traffic. This mechanism offers service differentiation to users with different contributions and has some desirable properties: (1) 
distributed nature upon gossip-based overlay structure and (2) practical oriented evaluation criteria. The experiment results over {PlanetLab} further verify its effectiveness},

This application-layer multicast tree has a height logarithmic with the number of clients and a node degree bounded by a constant. This helps reduce the number of processing hops on the delivery path to a client while avoiding network bottleneck. Consequently, the end-to-end delay is kept small. Although one could build a tree satisfying such properties easily, an efficient control protocol between the nodes must be in place to maintain the tree under the effects of network dynamics and unpredictable client behaviors. {ZIGZAG} handles such situations gracefully requiring a constant amortized control overhead. Especially, failure recovery can be done regionally with little impact on the existing clients and mostly no burden on the server.},

	abstract = {Video-on-demand {(VoD)} streaming has recently become a popular service on the Internet, with several companies offering videos to a global audience. However, traditional client/server based {VoD} streaming systems can be very bandwidth intensive and expensive to maintain, especially for high quality video content. To improve the scalability these systems, the use of peer-to-peer {(P2P)} networking has been proposed, but despite the efficiency of applications such as {BitTorrent} for downloading of large files, it is not simple to use {P2P} techniques for streaming. Problems such as firewalls and freeloaders reduce the efficiency of both types of {P2P} systems, but for real-time services such as streaming, the result can be reduced playback quality. Other issues include the traffic load imposed on {ISPs} by {P2P} networks, which can motivate {ISPs} to interfere with the {P2P} traffic. Finally, protecting against malicious modification of content can increase overhead, response times, and startup 
delays. We consider these issues to be fundamental to the problem of {P2P} based {VoD}, but despite the large amount of research that has been done in this field, these issues have largely been ignored. To address this, we present an evaluation of the Streaming {P2P} Protocol {(SPP)} architecture. By studying the problem as a whole we have found a simple and comprehensive solution that addresses all the four issues listed above. To show that the system is not only scalable, but also that it can be implemented efficiently, we have used both simulations and experiments on {PlanetLab} for evaluation. The results show that the combination of cache nodes and use of end-user resources found in the {SPP} architecture can give a low load on servers and {ISPs}, even when firewalls are taken into consideration. Furthermore, we observed low startup delays and few playback errors during the {PlanetLab} experiments. The scalable and low-cost distribution of content possible with the {SPP} architecture should be suitable 
for both large-scale commercial distributors and users of community networks with limited resources.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that, besides simplicity and robustness, with proper parameter settings, when the server bandwidth is above several times of the raw streaming rate, which is reasonable for practical live streaming system, simple pull-based {P2P} streaming protocol is nearly optimal in terms of peer upload capacity utilization and system throughput even without intelligent scheduling and bandwidth measurement. We also indicate that whether this near optimality can be achieved depends on the parameters in pull-based protocol, server bandwidth and group size. Then we present our mathematical analysis to gain deeper insight in this characteristic of pull-based streaming protocol. On the other hand, the optimality of pull-based protocol comes from a cost -tradeoff between control overhead and delay, that is, the protocol has either large control overhead or large delay. To break the tradeoff, 
we propose a pull-push hybrid protocol. The basic idea is to consider pull-based protocol as a highly efficient bandwidth-aware multicast routing protocol and push down packets along the trees formed by pull-based protocol. Both simulation and real-world experiment show that this protocol is not only even more effective in throughput than pull-based protocol but also has far lower delay and much smaller overhead. And to achieve near optimality in peer capacity utilization without churn, the server bandwidth needed can be further relaxed. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is fully implemented in our deployed {GridMedia} system and has the record to support over 220,000 users simultaneously online.},

The traditional pull mode in the unstructured overlay has inherent robustness to high churn rate which is common in peer-to-peer environment while the push mode could efficiently diminish the accumulated latency observed at end users. A practical system based on this architecture has been developed, and we evaluate its performance on {PlanetLab} [10] in various rigorous conditions. All the results demonstrate that the proposed push-pull method in {GridMedia} achieves good performance even with high group change rate and very low

	abstract = {This paper presents {DONet}, a data-driven overlay network for live media streaming. The core operations in {DONet} are very simple: every node periodically exchanges data availability information with a set of partners, and retrieves unavailable data from one or more partners, or supplies available data to partners. We emphasize three salient features of this data-driven design: 1) easy to implement, as it does not have to construct and maintain a complex global structure; 2) efficient, as data forwarding is dynamically determined according to data availability while not restricted by specific directions; and 3) robust and resilient, as the partnerships enable adaptive and quick switching among multi-suppliers. We show through analysis that {DONet} is scalable with bounded delay. We also address a set of practical challenges for realizing {DONet}, and propose an efficient member and partnership management algorithm, together with an intelligent scheduling algorithm that achieves real-time and 
continuous distribution of streaming contents. We have extensively evaluated the performance of {DONet} over the {PlanetLab.} Our experiments, involving almost all the active {PlanetLab} nodes, demonstrate that {DONet} achieves quite good streaming quality even under formidable network conditions. Moreover, its control overhead and transmission delay are both kept at low levels. An Internet-based {DONet} implementation, called {CoolStreaming} v.0.9, was released on May 30, 2004, which has attracted over 30000 distinct users with more than 4000 simultaneously being online at some peak times. We discuss the key issues toward designing {CoolStreaming} in this paper, and present several interesting observations from these large-scale tests; in particular, the larger the overlay size, the better the streaming quality it can deliver.},

We set out to ease the safe deployment of these applications by designing a congestion-controlled unreliable transport protocol. The outcome, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol or {DCCP}, adds to a {UDP-like} foundation the minimum mechanisms necessary to support congestion control. We thought those mechanisms would resemble {TCP's}, but without reliability and, especially, cumulative acknowledgements, we had to reconsider almost every aspect of {TCP's} design. The resulting protocol sheds light on how congestion control interacts with unreliable transport, how modern network constraints impact protocol design, and how {TCP's} reliable bytestream

The heterogeneity ranges from the individual links that carry the network's traffic, to the protocols that interoperate over the links, the "mix" of different applications used at a site, and the levels of congestion seen on different links. We discuss two key strategies for developing meaningful simulations in the face of these difficulties: searching for invariants and judiciously exploring the simulation parameter space. We finish with a brief look at a collaborative effort within the research community to develop a common network simulator.},

	abstract = {Emerging streaming media applications in the Internet primarily use {UDP} transport. The difficulty with supporting this type of traffic on the Internet is that they not only generate large volumes of traffic, but they are also not as responsive to network congestion as {TCP-based} applications. As a result, streaming media {UDP} traffic can cause two major problems in the Internet: congestion collapse and unfair allocations of bandwidth among competing traffic flows. A solution to these problems is available in many Internet environments. The Internet backbone, various {ISPs}, and {DSL} access networks rely on {ATM} as their layer 2 transport technology, and in such environments, {ATM's} available bit rate service can efficiently address these problems. {ABR} is able to avoid congestion collapse and provide fair bandwidth allocations by distributing the unutilized bandwidth fairly among competing flows. This article presents simulation results and empirical measurements that illustrate the 
congestion collapse and unfairness problems, and {ATM} {ABR's} effectiveness in addressing those problems},

We propose a simple architecture which consists of using distinct point-to-point {TCP} connections between adjacent pairs of end-systems, together with a back-pressure control mechanism regulating the transfers of adjacent {TCP} connections, as well as a back-up buffering system handling node failures. This architecture, that we call the one-to-many {TCP} overlay, is a natural extension of {TCP} to the one-to-many case, in that it adapts the rate of the group communication to local congestion in a decentralized way via the window back-pressure mechanism. Using theoretical investigations, experimentations in the Internet, and large network simulations, we show that this architecture provides end-to-end reliability and can tolerate multiple simultaneous node failures, provided the backup 
buffers are sized appropriately. We also show that under random perturbations caused by cross traffic described in the paper, the throughput of this reliable group communication is always larger than a positive constant, that does not depend on the group size. This scalability result contrasts with known results about the non-scalability of {IP-supported} multicast for reliable group communication.},

We have therefore established a method of detecting performance degradation at the {TCP} flow level from sampled flow behaviors. The proposed method is based on the following two flow characteristics: (i) sampled flows tend to have high flow-rates and (ii) when a link becomes congested, the performance of high-rate flows becomes degraded first. These characteristics indicate that sampled flows are sensitive to congestion, so we can detect performance degradation of flows that are sensitive to congestion by observing the rate of sampled flows. We also show the effectiveness of our method using measured data.},

This paper examines standard transport layer protocols, i.e. {UDP} and {TCP}, suited for real-time data delivery over Diffserv-capable networks where bandwidth guarantees are provided. We designed a streaming video application that buffers a portion of data on the receiver before starting the playback and operates in a streaming mode. Streaming media applications currently used in the Internet adopt {UDP} because of the general belief that {TCP's} reliable delivery mechanisms, such as congestion control and retransmission, are unsuitable for time-sensitive delivery. However, {TCP} shows the better simulation results than {UDP} when 
packets are lost over Diffserv networks. In our simulation, {TCP} can adapt its sending rate to the guaranteed bandwidth and the buffer on the receiver allows {TCP} to retransmit lost packets before the playback. As for {TCP}, the employment of {SACK} option that can recover lost packets efficiently contributes to a better performance.},

While many homes today are equipped with sufficient bandwidth {(DSL)} to support high quality live streaming, the quality of experience of a user is dismal: the video resolution and size is small and the displaying is often interrupted. One of the key problems arises because {TCP} is used as the underlying transport layer protocol: packet loss, retransmissions and timeouts prevent {TCP} from delivering a timely, steady flow of packets and thus inhibits the provision of online multimedia content. This paper presents {TCP-ROME}, a novel transport-layer framework that allows an establishment of multiple {TCP} connections between one client with possibly multiple home addresses and multiple co-located or distributed servers. The download over multiple {TCP} connections increases the total throughput by aggregating the resources of multiple {TCP} connections. Moreover, {
TCP-ROME} provides the means to overcome bandwidth fluctuations and network bottlenecks by dynamically coordinating the downloaded content from the different servers and by coordinating and adapting the streaming rate of the different connections to meet the bandwidth requirements of the video.},

	doi = {10.1109/INFCOM.2007.165},
	abstract = {Distributed media streaming, which uses multiple senders to collaboratively and simultaneously stream media content to a receiver, poses new challenges in congestion control. Such approach establishes multiple flows within a session. Since conventional congestion control only aims to make each of these flows {TCP-friendly}, selfish users can increase the number of flows to grab a larger share of the bandwidth, introducing more congestion and degrading the overall network performance. To address this issue, we propose the idea of task-level {TCP-friendliness}, which enforces {TCP-friendliness} upon a set of flows belonging to a task instead of upon individual flow. We design {DMSCC}, a congestion control scheme, to achieve task-level {TCP-friendliness} in distributed media streaming. By observing shared congestion, {DMSCC} identifies the set of flows experiencing congestion and dynamically adjusts those flows such that their combined throughput is {TCP-friendly.} To achieve this goal, {DMSCC} 
addresses two issues: (i) given a beta (beta {\textless} 1), how to control a flow using {AIMD} such that it consumes beta-times the throughput of a {TCP} flow, and (ii) how to identify the set of flows that share a bottleneck. In our simulations, {DMSCC} can effectively regulate the throughput of flows on every bottleneck, resulting in a {TCP-friendly} combined throughput.},

This paper proposes a new layered multicast with multilevel congestion marking {(LM-MCM).} A fundamental contribution of this scheme is introducing a multilevel congestion marking strategy {(MCM)} which enables a router to mark the congestion-flag field of each arriving {LM-MCM} packet according to the average queue size. Furthermore, based on the average congestion-flag, each receiver can improve/reduce the quality of service it receives to respond to the network congestion. We evaluated {LM-MCM} in a number of scenarios on {NS2} simulator. The results show {LM-MCM} converges quickly to the

	abstract = {{TCP} congestion control is based on an additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease {(AIMD)} probing paradigm aimed at adapting the sending rate of {TCP} data sources to match the Internet time-varying available bandwidth. Westwood+ {TCP} has been recently proposed to improve the tracking of available bandwidth of classic {TCP.} It is based on an end-to-end estimate of the available bandwidth, which is obtained by properly counting and filtering the stream of acknowledgement packets. The estimate is used to adaptively decrease the congestion window and slow start threshold after congestion so that it can be said that Westwood+ {TCP} substitutes the classic multiplicative decrease with an adaptive decrease paradigm. The authors propose a mathematical analysis of the additive-increase/adaptive-decrease {(AIADD)} paradigm to analyse the steady-state throughput provided by Westwood+ {TCP} and investigate the intra-protocol fairness of the {AIADD} paradigm and the inter-protocol friendliness between {
AIADD} and {AIMD} algorithms. It is shown that (i) both classic and Westwood+ {TCP} provide a throughput that is proportional to 1/√p, where p is the segment drop probability, that is they are friendly to each other; and (ii) the throughput of Westwood+ {TCP} is proportional to {1/√RTT}, where {RTT} is the round trip time, whereas the throughput of Reno {TCP} is proportional to {1/RTT}, i.e. Westwood+ {TCP} improves the intra-protocol fairness.

In case of the unavoidable network congestion, we unsubscribe scalable video layers according to the packet lost rate and the recently received throughput instead of only dropping one layer at a time to rapidly accommodate the streaming service to the channels and avoid persecuting the other flows at the same bottleneck.

The proposed protocol, referred to as Lightweight Streaming Protocol {(LSP)}, is an application layer protocol that sits atop {UDP.} The protocol is intended to improve the quality and reliability of media stream by borrowing features from reliable protocols such as retransmission and flow control while not sacrificing performance. The protocol offers semi-reliable transport. Instead of trying to guarantee 100\% data delivery the protocol simply recovers as many packets as possible within a specified deadline. In addition the protocol incorporates features such as probabilistic redundant {NAK} transmission and flow control through selective frame dropping. Preliminary simulations show that {LSP} performs extremely well in channels with random packet loss such as congested networks. The protocol also performs reasonably well in channels that have short bursts of lost packets such as wireless networks.},

	abstract = {Concurrent multipath transfer {(CMT)} uses the Stream Control Transmission Protocol's {(SCTP)} multihoming feature to distribute data across multiple end-to-end paths in a multihomed {SCTP} association. We identify three negative side-effects of reordering introduced by {CMT} that must be managed before efficient parallel transfer can be achieved: (1) unnecessary fast retransmissions by a sender; (2) overly conservative congestion window (cwnd) growth at a sender; and (3) increased ack traffic due to fewer delayed acks by a receiver. We propose three algorithms which augment and/or modify current {SCTP} to counter these side-effects. Presented with several choices as to where a sender should direct retransmissions of lost data, we propose five retransmission policies for {CMT.} We demonstrate spurious retransmissions in {CMT} with all five policies and propose changes to {CMT} to allow the different policies. {CMT} is evaluated against {AppStripe}, which is an idealized application that stripes 
data over multiple paths using multiple {SCTP} associations. The different {CMT} retransmission policies are then evaluated with varied constrained receive buffer sizes. In this foundation work, we operate under the strong assumption that the bottleneck queues on the end-to-end paths used in {CMT} are independent},

Moving picture experts group {(MPEG)} frames are with varying priorities and lifetime. {PR-CMT} can transmit important frames before other frames but does not transmit lifetime expired frames. The combination of the aforementioned techniques, however, causes imprecise congestion window and receiver buffer blocking problems without suitable control. Consequently, the throughput and video quality degrade. {PR-CMT} adopts the concept of delay abandoning data to resolve the imprecise cwnd and the receiver buffer blocking problems.

	abstract = {Various solutions based on {Peer-to-Peer} {(P2P)} multicasting have been gaining much popularity in recent years, since {P2P} multicasting can effectively support live streaming of various content. In this work we assume that the {P2P} multicasting is used to distribute content with high reliability requirements, e.g., weather warnings, security updates, financial data, security warnings, etc. The main idea to provide protection of the system against network failures is to establish several (at least two) disjoint multicasting trees. Our discussion in this paper centers on the problem how additional survivability constraints to provide failure-disjoint trees impact the operation of {P2P} multicasting systems. As the performance metrics we propose to use: streaming cost, maximum delay and throughput. The possible failure scenario we take into account is a single failure of one of the following network elements: streaming server, overlay link, uploading node and {ISP} link. We examine the topic of 
survivable {P2P} multicasting applying offline optimization methods and simulations. In the former case we formulate Mixed Integer Programming {(MIP)} models and use the {CPLEX} solver to obtain optimal results. For the streaming cost objective we compare two {MIP} formulations in terms of the complexity and execution time. Results show that our formulation provides much better performance compared to the classical {P2P} multicasting formulation proposed in the literature. Moreover, in the case of the streaming cost problem we propose a new evolutionary algorithm that yields results for larger networks than the {CPLEX} solver. The simulations are run to emulate a distributed network environment, in which each node makes its own decisions. Results obtained using both research methods confirm that the survivability of {P2P} multicasting can be achieved with relatively low additional system overhead for all three considered performance metrics: streaming cost, maximum delay and system throughput.},

Hence, new and old {P2P} systems like {KaZaA} and Gnutella are adopting super-peers in their design. Despite their growing popularity, the behavior of super-peer networks is not well understood. For example, what are the potential drawbacks of super-peer networks? How can super-peers be made more reliable?

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an unstructured peer-to-peer network called {GridMedia} for live media streaming employing a push-pull approach. Each node in {GridMedia} randomly selects its neighbors in the overlay and uses push-pull method to fetch data from the neighbors. The pull mode in the unstructured overlay which is inherently robust can work well with the high churn rate in {P2P} environment while the push mode can efficiently reduce the accumulated latency observed at user nodes. A practical system based on this framework has been developed. And the performance evaluation of our system which is established on {PlanetLab} [8] demonstrates that the pull-push method in {GridMedia} achieves good qualities even in high group change rate. Furthermore, our system was adopted by {CCTV} to broadcast the Gala Evening for Spring Festival 2005 through the Internet and attracted more than 500,000 users all over the world at that night with the incredibly maximum concurrent users of 15,239.},

	abstract = {Existing approaches to {P2P} streaming can be divided into two general classes: (i) tree-based approaches use push-based content delivery over multiple tree-shaped overlays, and (ii) mesh-based approaches use swarming content delivery over a randomly connected mesh. Previous studies have often focused on a particular {P2P} streaming mechanism and no comparison between these two classes has been conducted. In this paper, we compare and contrast the performance of representative protocols from each class using simulations. We identify the similarities and differences between these two approaches. Furthermore, we separately examine the behavior of content delivery and overlay construction mechanisms for both approaches in static and dynamic scenarios. Our results indicate that the mesh-based approach consistently exhibits a superior performance over the tree-based approach. We also show that the main factors attributing in the inferior performance of the tree-based approach are (i) the static 
mapping of content to a particular tree, and (ii) the placement of each peer as an internal node in one tree and as a leaf in all other trees.},

	abstract = {Overcast is an application-level multicasting system that can be incrementally deployed using today's Internet infrastructure. These properties stem from Overcast's implementation as an overlay network. An overlay network consists of a collection of nodes placed at strategic locations in an existing network fabric. These nodes implement a network abstraction on top of the network provided by the underlying substrate network. Overcast provides scalable and reliable single-source multicast using a simple protocol for building efficient data distribution trees that adapt to changing network conditions. To support fast joins, Overcast implements a new protocol for efficiently tracking the global status of a changing distribution tree. Results based on simulations confirm that Overcast provides its added functionality while performing competitively with {IP} Multicast. Simulations indicate that Overcast quickly builds bandwidth-efficient distribution trees that, compared to {IP} Multicast, provide 70\
%-100\% of the total bandwidth possible, at a cost of somewhat less than twice the network load. In addition, Overcast adapts quickly to changes caused by the addition of new nodes or the failure of existing nodes without causing undue load on the multicast source.},

	abstract = {Most of the real deployed peer-to-peer streaming systems adopt pull-based streaming protocol. In this paper, we demonstrate that, besides simplicity and robustness, with proper parameter settings, when the server bandwidth is above several times of the raw streaming rate, which is reasonable for practical live streaming system, simple pull-based {P2P} streaming protocol is nearly optimal in terms of peer upload capacity utilization and system throughput even without intelligent scheduling and bandwidth measurement. We also indicate that whether this near optimality can be achieved depends on the parameters in pull-based protocol, server bandwidth and group size. Then we present our mathematical analysis to gain deeper insight in this characteristic of pull-based streaming protocol. On the other hand, the optimality of pull-based protocol comes from a cost -tradeoff between control overhead and delay, that is, the protocol has either large control overhead or large delay. To break the tradeoff, 
we propose a pull-push hybrid protocol. The basic idea is to consider pull-based protocol as a highly efficient bandwidth-aware multicast routing protocol and push down packets along the trees formed by pull-based protocol. Both simulation and real-world experiment show that this protocol is not only even more effective in throughput than pull-based protocol but also has far lower delay and much smaller overhead. And to achieve near optimality in peer capacity utilization without churn, the server bandwidth needed can be further relaxed. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is fully implemented in our deployed {GridMedia} system and has the record to support over 220,000 users simultaneously online.},

	abstract = {The peer-to-peer communication paradigm is changing the way the Internet works, and the perspective network and service providers are looking at the telecommunication business. {P2P} applications and networks are taking foot by the day, and new systems are proposed continuously with ever novel features and better performances. In spite of attention and success, however, there is still a lack of fundamental analysis and understanding of the elementary properties of these systems. In this paper we consider a class of {P2P} protocols suitable both for content delivery (file-based communications) and for high-bandwidth media streaming like video and {TV}, and explore its fundamental properties. The class considered is known as mesh-based swarming push-pull systems or interleave protocols. They split the content in pieces and alternate continuously two phases: One where the peer pushes a piece to another peer to percolate information in the system, and the other when it pulls a piece trying to 
retrieve missing information. We compare synchronous and asynchronous models and explore the impact of protocols parameters, such as the dimension of the active neighborhood, trying to identify the efficiency of these very simple protocols in different scenarios, gaining insight to design the next protocol generation with performance and efficiency in mind.},

	abstract = {{P2P} live streaming systems are developed in two major approaches: tree-push versus mesh-pull. The hybrid push-pull streaming, as an emerging and promising approach, offers a good tradeoff between traffic overhead and system throughput. In this paper, we demonstrate that video redundancy is a large contributor of the traffic overhead in push-pull systems. To reduce the traffic overhead, we propose simple but effective sub-stream scheduling and re-scheduling mechanisms, implemented in a push-pull streaming prototype called Low-redundancy Streaming {(LStreaming).} To demonstrate its effectiveness on reducing the traffic overhead, we conduct both simulation and prototype experiments and compare the proposed {LStreaming} with random mesh-pull and {GridMedia.} The simulation results show that {LStreaming} significantly reduces the total traffic overhead, i.e., up to 33\% and 37\% reduction compared with mesh-pull and {GridMedia} in dynamic {P2P} environments, respectively. {LStreaming} also achieves 
the throughput, more close to the optimal value than the other two schemes, and sustains a better video playback quality. The prototype experiments show that {LStreaming} is practical and achieves the expected performance.},
